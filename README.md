# ngVue

*this angular module is still in early development*

[**VueJS**](https://vuejs.org/) is a library to build web interfaces with composable view components and reactive data binding. **ngVue**, inspired by [ngReact](https://github.com/ngReact/ngReact), is an Angular module that allows you to develop/use Vue components in AngularJS applications.

## Features

**ngVue** is composed of a directive `vue-component` and a factory `createVueComponent`:

- `vue-component` delegates data to a Vue component and applies the component to the DOM element 
- `createVueComponent` converts a Vue component into a `vue-component` directive


## TODO

- [ ] vue components
- [ ] vue directives
- [ ] unit tests
- [ ] simple examples
